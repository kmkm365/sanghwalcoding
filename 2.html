    <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
    <strong><u>Lorem Ipsum</u></strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
    been
    the
    industry's standard
    dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
    specimen
    book.</br>
    <p style="margin-top:40px">It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially
        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing <a
            href="https://www.naver.com/" target="_blank" title="naver.com">Lorem Ipsum
            passages</a>,
        and
        more
        recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
